<div class='section-title'>His life's work:</div>

<div class='basic-text'>It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump
   magazine since July 22, 1997, with the chapters collected into 86 tankōbon
   volumes to date. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy,
    a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally
     eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat
      Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate
      treasure known as "One Piece" in order to
       become the next Pirate King.</div>

<div class='col-8 basic-text'>Like many other manga artists, Oda seems to not use
   digital methods. This is a characteristic he shares with many mangaka,
    in terms of making a manga the most handcrafted as possible.
    That is something that non-Japanese artists do not often do,
    especially Americans and Europeans, who prefer the digital way of working
     over the traditional tools, for its easiness and high quality.
      Although is not confirmed, Oda does not seem to employ evident
       digital effects on his manga pages. </br>
       To make sketches and starting steps of page-drawing, he uses
       (like many other artists around the world, not only mangaka)
        pencils in conjunction with erasers and an art gum eraser to fix errors.
       To ink the pages, Oda utilizes the G-Pen, Maru Pen and sharp refillable
        pens for inking. For making corrections after inking,
         he uses white ink. </div>
